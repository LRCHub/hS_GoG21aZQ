This hammer sure feels heavy
This close to quittin' time
Even though I'm tired now
Soon I'll come alive

Wash my hands and change this shirt
And head out down the road
That takes me to the one I love
Waitin' there at home

And it's the sweetest place I've ever been
Calloused hands, love tender skin
That's where the good times all begin
Calloused hands, love tender skin

She knows the world I work in
Can sometimes take its toll
Hands that work so hard all day
Need someone soft to hold

She takes the perfume off the shelf
And lets her hair hang low
And when I hit the door
She's there to make sure that I know

That it's the sweetest place I've ever been
Calloused hands, love tender skin
That's where the good times all begin
Calloused hands, love tender skin

It's the sweetest place I've ever been
Calloused hands, love tender skin
That's where the good times all begin
Calloused hands, love tender skin
