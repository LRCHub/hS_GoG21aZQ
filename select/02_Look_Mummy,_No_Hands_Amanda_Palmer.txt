Remember the Fairmont
The two of us there, mom
By the merry-go-round?
I stood there entranced
As the bright horses danced
To a magical sound
Just a dollar for pleasure untold
And I rode in a whirl of scarlet and gold

Look, Mummy, no hands
I'm riding the roundabout all by myself
Look, Mummy, no hands
I called as I passed her, faster and faster
Hold on tight, darling
She called out in fear
But I laughed and pretended
That I couldn't hear
How careless we are when we're young

Remember the years
Of the sulks and the tears
Do you recall?
I hated you when you said
Be back by ten
I knew it all
Always asking to know what I'd done
When as far as I knew
I was just having fun

Look, Mummy, no hands
I know how to take good care of myself
Look, Mummy, no hands
Please don't be a bore, 'cause I know the score
She tried to warn me
But I didn't heed her
I was grown up
And I didn't need her
How careless we are when we're young

Remember the daughter
And all that you taught her?
She's grown up at last
With a child of her own
She struggles alone
As the years all rush pass
But now you're not there to answer her call
You're not there to catch her when she stumbles and falls

Look, Mummy, no hands
I'm having to do it all by myself
Look, Mummy, no hands
I used to dismiss you, now I just miss you
As my child grows away from me
I feel my heart sinking
I look back and smile
And I find myself thinking
How careless we are when we're young
