Charity begins at homes
For those too sick
Those indisposed
Footsteps in the corridor
Little Johnny's playing dead

They gave the Jack of Hands the key
He's free to tread and lift the sheets
He'll be dressed in white they said

But I don't believe in angels

When the good son rises
When we hear the birds
Little Johnny's curled up and crying
Alas a touch disturbed
The Jack of Hands is far away
He's opening a school
They'll offer him a chariot
But Jack prefers to walk

Dangerous

Hush now
Hush now
Jack is coming
Jack is coming
Shush now
Shush now
Like you're sleeping
Like you're sleeping
He's carrying his special box
No one ever asks what's in it
No more suffer little children
Jack'll fix it
Jack'll fix it

It's Jack the national treasure
Jack's beating on his chest
He's flying off to Africa
Cause Africa's the best

They'll cordon off the airport
Because the crowd is vast
He'll be home at last

Still I don't believe in angels
